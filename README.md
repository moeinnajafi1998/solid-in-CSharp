# SOLID Principles in C#

This repository contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles as implemented in C#. The SOLID principles are five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.

## SOLID Principles Overview

- **D: [Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)](#dependency-inversion-principle-dip)**

## Principles

### Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change, meaning that it should have only one job or responsibility.

### Open/Closed Principle (OCP)

The Open/Closed Principle suggests that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.

### Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)

The Liskov Substitution Principle indicates that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of a subclass without affecting the correctness of the program.

### Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)

The Interface Segregation Principle advises that clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use. Instead of one fat interface, multiple small interfaces are preferred.

### Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

The Dependency Inversion Principle emphasizes that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details, but details should depend on abstractions.
